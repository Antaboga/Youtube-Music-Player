## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and rain animation effect.
- **JavaScript**: Handles API requests, search results display, and video playback.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the app.

3. **YouTube API Key Setup**:
   - This app requires a YouTube Data API key.
   - Replace the `API_KEY` placeholder in the code with your own key:
